# Games-similarity-search-engine
This repository contains an innovative Games Similarity Search Engine, developed as part of a university project, to help gamers explore related titles from a digital marketplace for gamers. The project encompasses three main components:

Web Scraping: Leveraging web scraping techniques, the project gathers essential game information from the digital gaming marketplace. Collected data includes game titles, genres, descriptions, prices, and links.

Similarity Search Engine: Powered by the versatile Transformers library, this component enables sophisticated similarity analysis on the accumulated gaming data. Leveraging the capabilities of Transformers, the system adeptly processes natural language and context, providing informative and tailored game recommendations.

Dialogflow Integration with Flask: Seamlessly integrating with Dialogflow, a natural language processing platform, the project utilizes Flask, a lightweight web framework, to create a user-friendly chatbot interface. Gamers can now interact organically with the chatbot, discovering personalized game suggestions catered to their unique interests.



## Dialogflow Integration Branch

The **Dialogflow Integration** branch focuses on incorporating the search engine functionality into a chatbot powered by Dialogflow. The chatbot will enable users to interact with the game similarity search engine through natural language queries.

### Usage

Once the integration is complete, users can communicate with the chatbot by providing game titles or categories as inputs. The chatbot will respond with game recommendations or a list of games that belong to the most similar category, along with their prices.

Please ensure the required libraries and models are available for both the search engine and Dialogflow integration. Additionally, the search engine relies on the dataset provided in `data1 copy.csv`.

For any improvements or issues related to the Dialogflow integration, feel free to contribute to this branch or open a pull request.
