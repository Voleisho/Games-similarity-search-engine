# Games-similarity-search-engine
This repository contains an innovative Games Similarity Search Engine, developed as part of a university project, to help gamers explore related titles from a digital marketplace for gamers. The project encompasses three main components:

Web Scraping: Leveraging web scraping techniques, the project gathers essential game information from the digital gaming marketplace. Collected data includes game titles, genres, descriptions, prices, and links.

Similarity Search Engine: Powered by the versatile Transformers library, this component enables sophisticated similarity analysis on the accumulated gaming data. Leveraging the capabilities of Transformers, the system adeptly processes natural language and context, providing informative and tailored game recommendations.

Dialogflow Integration with Flask: Seamlessly integrating with Dialogflow, a natural language processing platform, the project utilizes Flask, a lightweight web framework, to create a user-friendly chatbot interface. Gamers can now interact organically with the chatbot, discovering personalized game suggestions catered to their unique interests.
